# Vencord Auto Patcher (macOS)
An efficient program which patches Vencord whenever Discord updates on macOS.</br>
On macOS, Vencord doesn't automatically patch itself when Discord updates, so this is a fix for that.

## Features
- Patches Vencord automatically, even through Discord updates
- VencordInstaller.app can patch Vencord without any user interaction, unlike the official installer
    - This is due to modifications made to the installer source. All references to UI in cli.go have been removed for optimization purposes.
- Notifications are used to communicate success, failure, and errors
- Very efficient, with <=0.1% of CPU and <5MB of RAM being used at idle</br>
**NOTE: The only entirely supported OS for this project is macOS. Windows will still be supported for the one-click installer, but this may change at any time.**

## Requirements
All original requirements for building the official installer apply here.</br>
Go 1.25.1 is also recommended, but you can probably use a lower version instead.

## Installation
Run install.sh through ZSH to install Vencord Auto Patcher.
I may release a pre-built app with the launchd plist through GitHub Releases soonâ„¢.
